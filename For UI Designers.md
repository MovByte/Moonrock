# For UI Designers

Here is the original [sketch](./first-sketch.jpg) I had. Dave is currently working on porting it to be a [Figma sketch](https://www.figma.com).

## Changes from the original sketch that I made in retrospect

### The internal game player UI

It will have three visible buttons at the top:

- Left - Home Button
- Center - An omnibox that shows the results on the same page in fullscreen with there will be a back button. The results will be the:
  1. Autocomplete from the search engine
  2. The regular game aggregation from the queried term
     > I call this system live results
- Right - A hamburger menu. The other options not listed there, but in the original sketch, will contained be in the hamburger menu.
